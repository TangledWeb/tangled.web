"""System handlers.

Requests are processed through a chain of handlers. This module contains
the "system" handlers. These are handlers that always run in a specific
order.

Most of the system handlers *always* run. They can't be turned off, but
you can swap in different implementations via settings. Take a look at
:file:`tangled/web/defaults.ini` to see how you would do this.

Some handlers are only enabled when certain settings are enabled or when
certain configuration takes place. For example, to enable CSRF
protection, the ``tangled.app.csrf.enabled`` setting needs to be set to
``True``. Another example: the static files handlers is only enabled
when at least one static directory has been mounted.

If an auth handler is enabled, it will run directly before any (other)
handlers added by the application developer.

All added handlers are called in the order they were added. The last
handler to run is always the :func:`main` handler; it calls into
application code (i.e., it calls a resource method to get data or
a response).
