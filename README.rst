Tangled.Web is a somewhat opinionated, resource oriented Web framework. It
might be considered a "micro" framework because it simply provides a way to map
HTTP requests to resources and has no opinions regarding databases, templating,
etc.

Unlike many other frameworks, there are no "views" or "controllers" here, only
resources. Resources respond to HTTP requests and return representations based
on the client's preference (indicated via Accept headers).
