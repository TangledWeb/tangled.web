Quick Start

This is a short guide that shows how to create a Web application based on
``tangled.web``.

Install Python 3.3+
===================

First, install Python 3.3. Older versions of Python *will not* work. Mainly,
this is because of the use of built-in namespace package support that was
added in Python 3.3.

Virtual Env
===========

Next, set up an isolated virtual environment. Since we're using Python 3, this
is built in. The command for creating a new virtual env looks like this::

    python3 -m venv myproject
