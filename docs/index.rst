Tangled Web
+++++++++++

A resource oriented, Python 3 only Web framework.

No controllers. No views. Just resources and representations.

Also, there are no magic globals. There is an
:class:`Application <tangled.web.app.Application>` object that contains your
app's configuration. It is passed to resources along with the current request.
