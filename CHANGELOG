0.1a7 (unreleased)
==================

- The Accept header can now be set via a file name extension in URL. For
  example, the URL /users.json will cause the Accept header to be set to
  application/json, and the .json extension will remove from the request's path
  before the request is passed down to the application. This functionality is
  enabled via the tangled.app.set_accept_from_ext setting (it defaults to on).
- Encode date and datetime objects as timestamps in JSON responses (only if
  custom encoding hasn't been configured).
- Make exception log messages configurable. The
  tangled.app.exc_log_message_factory setting can be pointed at a function that
  accepts an app, request, and exception and returns a string.
- Start adding "main" (i.e., prose) documentation.
- Slightly improve package metadata.


0.1a6 (2014-02-10)
==================

- Add download_url to setup().
- Make app factory configurable in WSGI app recipe. Previously, it was hard
  coded as `tangled.web.Application`.


0.1a5 (2014-02-09)
==================

- Fix more packaging issues

  - Include package data (i.e., include scaffolds)
  - Add .template extension to .py files in basic scaffold that use ${var}s

- Require released version of tangled 0.1a5 or newer

- Update trove classifiers

  - Declare support for Python 3.3 and 3.4 specifically (instead of generic
    Python 3)


0.1a4 (2014-02-06)

  it's more correct in the sense that a namespace package may include Python
  modules.
- Include package data (ensure defaults.ini and scaffolds get installed).
