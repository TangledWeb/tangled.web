0.1a8 (2014-03-22)
==================

- Simplify and improve settings parsing. In particular, move settings parsing
  logic from `Application.__init__()` to a new `settings.make_app_settings()`
  function. The purpose of this is to make it easy for apps to do custom
  settings parsing by calling `make_app_settings()` and passing the result to
  `Application`. In simple cases, though, this can be ignored, and a plain
  dict or settings file name can be passed to `Application` as before.
- As part of the above, `Application` no longer accepts a `parse_settings` arg;
  `make_app_settings()` has a `parse` arg instead that serves the same purpose
  (disabling parsing, since it's enabled by default).
- Also part of the above: the `parse_settings()` and `parse_settings_file()`
  functions were removed from `settings` and the corresponding static methods
  were removed from `Application`. They weren't very useful in the first place
  and are less so now.
- Fix generation of application.wsgi via wsgi_application recipe: pass extra
  settings to `Application` via `**` instead of passing the extra settings dict
  as a single keyword arg.
- In quick start doc, install dependencies via PyPI rather than git (now that
  releases have been made of the relevant packages).
- Upgrade tangled from 0.1a6 to 0.1a7. 0.1a7 contains some fixes and
  improvements to settings parsing.


0.1a7 (unreleased)
==================

- The Accept header can now be set via a file name extension in URL. For
  example, the URL /users.json will cause the Accept header to be set to
  application/json, and the .json extension will remove from the request's path
  before the request is passed down to the application. This functionality is
  enabled via the tangled.app.set_accept_from_ext setting (it defaults to on).
- Encode date and datetime objects as timestamps in JSON responses (only if
  custom encoding hasn't been configured).
- Make exception log messages configurable. The
  tangled.app.exc_log_message_factory setting can be pointed at a function that
  accepts an app, request, and exception and returns a string.
- Start adding "main" (i.e., prose) documentation.
- Slightly improve package metadata.


0.1a6 (2014-02-10)
==================

- Add download_url to setup().
- Make app factory configurable in WSGI app recipe. Previously, it was hard
  coded as `tangled.web.Application`.


0.1a5 (2014-02-09)
==================

- Fix more packaging issues

  - Include package data (i.e., include scaffolds)
  - Add .template extension to .py files in basic scaffold that use ${var}s

- Require released version of tangled 0.1a5 or newer

- Update trove classifiers

  - Declare package to be Alpha status
  - Declare support for Python 3.3 and 3.4 specifically (instead of generic
    Python 3)


0.1a4 (2014-02-06)
==================

- Include tangled in packages list. Not sure this is strictly necessary, but
  it's more correct in the sense that a namespace package may include Python
  modules.
- Include package data (ensure defaults.ini and scaffolds get installed).


0.1a3 (2014-02-06)
==================

- Fix packaging issues.
- Reimplement the `tangled shell` command as a subclass of
  `tangled.scripts.ShellCommand`.


0.1a2 (2014-02-05)
==================

- Fix packaging issues.


0.1a1 (2014-02-05)
==================

First release.
